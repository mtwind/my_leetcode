    "## Base\n",
    "\n",
    "**Meaning of Base**\n",
    "\n",
    "- base is a carry counting system with fixed digital symbols and rules\n",
    "- the actual value of a **base-X** number is determined by each digit and its location\n",
    "    - the weight of the m<sup>th</sup> dith counrting from right to left in the integer part is X<sup>m</sup>, and the smallest value of *m* is 0.\n",
    "    - the weight of the n<sup>th</sup> digit counting from left to right in the fractional part is X<sup>-n</sup>, and the smallest value of *n* is 1\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, 123.45 in decimal (base-10) can be written as: \n",
    "    - 123.45 = 1 X 10<sup>2</sup> + 2 X 10<sup>1</sup> + 3 X 10<sup>0</sup> + 4 X 10<sup>-1</sup> + 5 X 10<sup>-2</sup>\n",
    "    - 720.5 in octal(base-8) can be written as:\n",
    "        - 720.5<sub>(8)</sub> = 7 X 8<sup>2</sup> + 2 X 8<sup>1</sup> + 0 X 8<sup>0</sup> + 5 X 8<sup>-1</sup>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Commonly used bases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- commonly used bases include base-10 (decimal), base-2 (binary), base-16 (hexadecimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conversion between bases**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Non-decimal to decimal*\n",
    "    - to convert a non-decimal number to decimal, simply add the weighted sum of each digit\n",
    "- *Decimal to non-decimal*\n",
    "    - to convert a decimal number to a base-X non-decimal, we need to convert the integer part and the fractional part, separately \n",
    "        - to convert the integer part, we will integer divide it by X until it reaches 0, and record the remainder each time\n",
    "        - traversing the remainder in reverse order will give us the representation in base-X system \n",
    "            - 50 in decimal to binary\n",
    "                - 50 / 2 = 25; 50 % 2 = 0\n",
    "                - 25 / 2 = 12; 25 % 2 = 1\n",
    "                - 12 / 2 = 6; 12 % 2 = 0\n",
    "                - 6 / 2 = 3; 6 % 2 = 0\n",
    "                - 3 / 2 = 1; 3 % 2 = 1\n",
    "                - 1 / 2 = 0; 1 % 2 = 1\n",
    "                - this gives us **110010**\n",
    "        - to convert the fractional part, we will multiply the fractional part of the decimal number by **X** until it becomes 0 and record the integer part each time. Traversing the integer part in order will give us the representation in base-X system\n",
    "            - For example, to convert decimal number 0.6875 to binary:\n",
    "                - 0.6875 X 2 = 1.375 with integer 1\n",
    "                - 0.375 X 2 = 0.75 with integer 0\n",
    "                - 0.75 X 2 = 1.5 with integer 1\n",
    "                - 0.5 X 2 = 1 with integer 1\n",
    "                - this gives us **0.1011** in binary\n",
    "    - *Conversion between other bases*\n",
    "        - Standard is to convert one to decimal and then convert from there\n",
    "        - However, if digits are multiples of one another, you may convert in another way\n",
    "            - each digit in an octal number can be represented as three digits in a binary number\n",
    "            - each digit in a hexadecimal number can be represented as four binary digits\n",

    "# Concepts and Properties of Bitwise Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview or Bit Operations\n",
    "- Computers use binary, so all basic operations are realized through bit operations\n",
    "- there are six types of bit operations: AND, OR, XOR, negation, left shift, and right shift\n",
    "    - left and right shifts are referred to as shift operations\n",
    "    - shift operations are further divided into arithmetic and logical shifts\n",
    "- among bit operations, only the negation is a unary operation, and the rest are binary operations \n",
    "\n",
    "**AND, OR, XOR, and Negation**\n",
    "- The symbol of the AND operation is &, and the operation rule is:\n",
    "    for each binary bit, when the corresponding bits of both number are 1, the result is 1; Otherwise, the result is 0\n",
    "- The symbol of the OR operation is |, and the rule is\n",
    "    - if either bit of both number is 1, the result is 1\n",
    "- The symbol of the XOR operation is ⊕ (in the code, we usually use ^ to represent XOR), and the operation rule is:\n",
    "    - For each binary bit, when the corresponding bits of the two numbers are the same, the result is 0; Otherwise, the result is 1\n",
    "- The symbol of the negation operation is ~, and the rule is\n",
    "    - flip each binary bit of a number\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shift Operation**\n",
    "- The shift operation can be divided into the left shift and the right shift according to the shift direction and can be divided into arithmetic shift and logical shift according to whether it is signed\n",
    "- the symbol for the left shift operation is <<\n",
    "    - in a left shift, all binary bits are shifted to the left by several bits, the high bits are discarded, and the low bits are filled with 0\n",
    "    - for left shift, arithmetic and logical shift are the same\n",
    "    - 29 << 3 is 00011101 -> 11101000 \n",
    "        - 11101000 (complement) -> 11100111 (inverse) -> 10011000 (original)\n",
    "- the symbol for the right shift operator is >>\n",
    "    - all binary bits are shifted right by several bits, the low bits are discarded and how the high bits get filled differs between arithmetic shift and logical shift\n",
    "        - arithmetic: high bits filled with the highest bit\n",
    "        - logical: high bit filled with 0\n",
    "- Which right shift operation is used?\n",
    "    - in C/C++, there is signed/unsigned keywords, where default is signed\n",
    "        - for signed types, the right shift operation is arithmetic\n",
    "        - for unsigned, the right shift operation is logical\n",
    "    - in Java, there are no unsigned types, so we distinguish between arithmetic and logical\n",
    "        - arithmetic right shift is >>\n",
    "        - logical right shift is >>>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship between shift operations and multiplication/division**\n",
    "- bit operations are much more efficient than direct multiplication and division\n",
    "- the left shift operation corresponds to multiplication\n",
    "    - shifting left by k bits is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2<sup>k</sup>\n",
    "    - when the multiplier is not an integer power of 2, the multiplier can be slipt into the sum of the integer powers of 2\n",
    "        - a * 6 = ( a << 2 ) + ( a << 1 )\n",
    "    - any integer can be multiplied by the left shift operation, but you need to be careful with overflow\n",
    "- the arithmetic right shift operation corresponds to the division operation\n",
    "    - shifting a number ot the right by k bits is equivalents to dividing the number by 2<sup>k</sup>\n",
    "    - note that arithmetic right shift of a number by k  digit is NOT equivalent to performing integer division by 2<sup>k</sup>\n",
    "        - this is true for positive numbers but not negatives\n",
    "            - Integer division is rounded to 0, while the right shift is rouned down\n",
    "                - (-50) >> 2 = -13\n",
    "                - (-50) / 4 = -12 \n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties of bitwise operations**\n",
    "- Bit operations have many properties. Here, we will list common properties of AND, OR, XOR, and negation in bit operations. We assume that the variables below are all signed integers.\n",
    "    - Idempotent law: a & a = a, a | a = a (note that XOR does not satisfy the idempotent law);\n",
    "    - Commutative law: a & b = b & a, a | b = b | a, 𝑎 ⊕ 𝑏 = 𝑏 ⊕ 𝑎;\n",
    "    - Associativity: (a & b) & c = a & (b & c), (a | b) | c = a | (b | c), (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c);\n",
    "    - Distributive Law: (a & b) | c = (a | c) & (b | c), (a | b) & c = (a & c) | (b & c), (a ⊕ b) & c = (a & c) ⊕ (b & c);\n",
    "    - De Morgan's Law: ∼ (a & b) = (∼a) | (∼b), ∼ (a | b) = (∼a) & (∼b);\n",
    "    - Negative operation properties: -1 = ∼0, -a = ∼(a−1);\n",
    "    - AND operation properties: a & 0 = 0, a & (-1) = a, a & ( ∼a)=0;\n",
    "    - OR operation properties: a | 0 = a, a | (∼a) = −1;\n",
    "    - XOR operation properties: a ⊕ 0 = a，a ⊕ a = 0;\n",
    "    - Other properties: The result of a & (a−1) is to change the last 1 in the binary representation of a to 0; The result of a & (-a) (equivalent to a & (∼(a−1))) is to keep only the last 1 of the binary representation of a, and set the remaining 1s to 0. Using these properties, many bit operation problems can be solved strategically.\n"
